# pi-standoff-mount

## Introduction

This is a 3D-printable [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) mount with stand
offs for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) Standard (85.6 mm
Ã— 56.5 mm) form factor (models 2B/3B/3B+/4B). It is a very simple alternative
to a full case that is simple and quick to print and install.

## Model

There is one model:

<div class="model" data-name="Pi Standoff Mount" data-icon-size="128" data-left-icon="pi-standoff-mount.icon.png" data-left="pi-standoff-mount.stl"><!-- expanded by annotate-model --><table align="center" width="100%"><tbody><tr width="100%"><td align="center" width="160" height="160"><a href="../media/media/pi-standoff-mount.stl" target="_blank" title="View Pi Standoff Mount Model"><img src="../media/media/pi-standoff-mount.icon.png" alt="Pi Standoff Mount Model" width="128" height="128" /></a></td><td>

### Mount

The mount has four holes for stand-offs and two holes for wall attachments. Many dimensions
can be modified and adjusted by working with source and the OpenSCAD customizer.

## Printing

I use a Creality Ender 3 Pro to build from PLA with a layer height of 0.20mm.
Since there are counter-bored screw holes, you may wish to flip this model
upside down in your slicer software before printing.

## Installation

You'll need four female stand-offs with two matching screws on either end
(eight in total), along with two more screws if you wish to attach the
entire mount to a wall.

1.  Screw the four stand offs into the base with small screws from the
    concealed recesses on the bottom of the mounts.
2.  Two larger screws go through the base into the wall.
3.  Screw the Raspberry Pi onto the stand-offs.

## Source

The mount is built using OpenSCAD. *pi-standoff-mount.scad* is the main
file for the mount.

### Raspberry Pi Models

Note that Raspberry Pi Models can be used to visualize and verify the relative
positions of ports and mounts on the stand-offs. These are optional and
available from third parties. There are two models:

1.  Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Reference Design from [Mechatronics Art on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-3-reference-design-model-b-rpi-raspberrypi-raspberry-pi-1)
    in file *Raspberry\_Pi\_3\_Light\_Version.STL*.

2.  Raspberry Pi 4 Model from [Coder-Tronics on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3732868)
    in file *RPi4.STL*.
