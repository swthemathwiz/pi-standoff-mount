# pi-standoff-mount

This is a 3D-printable [Openscad](https://openscad.org/) wall mount with stand offs for the Raspberry PI.

## Source

The wall mount is built using Openscad. _pi-standoff-mount.scad_ is the main file for the wall mount.

### Raspberry Pi Models

Models are used to visualize and verify the relative positions of ports and mounts on the stand-offs and are optional. There are two models:

1. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Reference Design from [Mechatronics Art on GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/raspberry-pi-3-reference-design-model-b-rpi-raspberrypi-raspberry-pi-1) in file _Raspberry_Pi_3_Light_Version.STL_.

2. Raspberry Pi 4 Model from [Coder-Tronics on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3732868) in file _RPi4.STL_.

## 3D Printing

I used a Creality Ender 3 Pro to build from PLA with a layer height of 0.20mm.

## Installing

You'll need four stand-offs with two matching screws on each end (eight in total), along with two more screws to attach the entire mount to the wall.  

1. Screw the four stand offs into the base with small screws from the concealled recesses on the bottom of the mounts.
2. Two larger screws go through the base into the wall.
3. Screw the Raspberry PI onto the stand-offs.
